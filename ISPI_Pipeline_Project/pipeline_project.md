# ISPI Pipeline Project

 Version: 0.1

 Date: 2020-04-17

## Design Constraints

- Should make use of most astropy-maintained code as possible, this reduces the
amount of code that we have to maintain.
- Should comply with styling conventions (PEP)
- Procedures should be reusable
- Should have high testing coverage, above `95%` is acceptable for release of
`version 1.0.0`.
- Version `1.0.0` is released when its considered fully capable of producing
*science ready results* this should happen during or shortly after science
verification phase.


## Tasks

Some of the tasks are not isolated from each other. During the full duration of
the development process some time might be dedicated to contributing with related
bug fixes or documentation to some astropy packages.

- [1 Week] Get familiar with old ISPI Data and HAWAII-2RG data and
re-familiarize with Infrared (IR) data reduction procedures for imaging.
- [2 Weeks] Familiarize with existing IRAF pipelines for IR data reduction
(NEWFIRM, RetroCam) as well as the ISPI procedures.
- [1 Week] Establish package structure, development workflow, setup CI/CD tools.
- [12 Weeks] Develop and document code.
- [4 Weeks] Create user documentation.
- [8 Weeks] Complete automated testing

Total time: 28 Weeks or 7 Month
