# Notes from Meeting 2017/11/30
 - The meeting was quick and all agreed that Simon should focus on implementation of
 non-linear wavelength solutions. The implications of this are the following:
   - Re-calibrate all the lamps and store the wavelength solution as a non-linear
   solution leaving the data untouched.
   - Implement wcs or gwcs into the pipeline.
