# Notes from 2017/11/16 software meeting

- [Question] What is the best place to do the image combination?
    - After the cosmic ray rejection although using a median combine before 
    would reduce the number of them.
    - Has to be in the first part of the process `redccd`
    - Add at least two options for methods to do the combination `average` or
    `median`. `average` should have at least `sigma-clip` rejection and the
    option of not doing any.
    
- [TODO] Finish ADASS proceeding, deadline 30 November (Highest Priority)

- [TODO] Send e-mail to UNC team regarding issues with `TRIMSEC` values
    - Some of the _keywords_ that allow to define the trimsection are:
        `binning`, `paralell origin`, `paralell length`, `serial origin` and
        `serial_length`.
        
- [NOTE] Criterium for data classification
    - For **Spectroscopy**:
        - Ignore all images with `CAM_TARG == 0`
    - For **Imaging**:
        - Ignore all images with `CAM_TARG != 0`
        
- [NOTE] An option for processing nights with imaging and spectroscopy data would
    be to create two folders `RED_IMG` and `RED_SPEC`. Alternatively this could
    be done always.
    
- [NOTE] Criterium for new keywords:
    - Bruno proposed to use `GHTS_XYZ` where GHTS means _Goodman Hight
    Throughput Spectrograph_
    - Finally we decided to use `GSP_XXXX` since this would give us for
    characters to specify the content of the keyword. The first three characters
    indicate that is a keyword generated by the Goodman Spectroscopic Pipeline.
