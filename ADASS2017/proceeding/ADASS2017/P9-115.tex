\begin{abstract}
The Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph (Goodman Spectrograph) is a highly
versatile instrument in operation at the SOAR Telescope on Cerro Pachon, Chile.
It is capable of doing low to mid-resolution spectroscopy in a range from 3200 \AA{}
to 9000 \AA{}. The data reduction pipeline is conceived as an easy-to-run software,
that can process an entire night worth of data by execution of a simple command,
with some arguments, from a terminal window. It is written almost entirely in
Python, following several Python standard conventions.
We aim towards using exclusively standard Python packages, such as Astropy and
Astropy-affiliated packages, while at the same time allowing for fast and
efficient computing.
In its present form the pipeline produces fully reduced, wavelength-calibrated
spectra. Flux calibration will be an add-on option for a later release.

\section{Introduction}

The Goodman Spectrograph \citep{2004SPIE.5492..331C} is a highly customizable spectrograph in operation at
the 4-meter SOAR Telescope on Cerro Pachon, northern Chile.
It is capable of delivering spectra in a wavelength range from 3200 \AA{} to 9000 \AA{}
with resolving power ($R=\lambda/\Delta\lambda$) ranging from 800 to 14,000
depending on the configuration. The Goodman Spectrograph is the workhorse
instrument of the SOAR Telescope, with about 65\% of the available time on the sky.
Hence the need of a dedicated pipeline. Although IRAF is considered by many the standard tool
in data reduction, its scope is to provide data reduction and processing
capabilities to a rather wide variety of cases, thus is a bit hard to implement
as an automatic pipeline. The SOAR Telescope in general is in a path to increased automation, looking forward to be
an efficient follow up facility in the LSST era. We chose Python because of its
versatility, completeness and because it allows for fast development and
robust products. The existence and maturity of Astropy and its affiliated
packages was also a big motivation to choose Python.
Our initial plan considered a Python-only project but we had to change that
because LaCosmic \citep{2001PASP..113.1420V} did not provide satisfactory results and we had to shift
to using a program called DCR \citep{2004PASP..116..148P} which is written in C,
works very well but does not integrate into Python easily, ideally this
should be converted into a python C++ extension.
LaCosmic implementation is still part of the pipeline and can be selected with a command
line argument.
Also we wanted the pipeline to be open source and available for everyone; in fact the full
project is available on GitHub.

Compared to other tools for data reduction the Goodman Spectroscopic Pipeline
will provide clear advantages to users of the Goodman Spectrograph, by allowing
them to run full processing of their spectra with a one-line command, that produces
wavelength-calibrated, science quality results. Ours is not the first or only
effort in providing a pipeline for reducing Goodman spectra, however, it is the
first one developed not as a solution for one specific project, but rather as a community tool.
It has been conceived to be simple to use and very well documented, so users can
clearly understand each processing step, and even further develop and modify the
software.

\section{Pipeline Concept \& Structure}

The pipeline project started as two parallel projects, one for image reduction
and one for spectra reduction. Very soon we realized they could not be isolated 
but should be part of an integrated system. They evolved into a single project with two main
packages that work together. In the current stable version (1.0b1) the pipeline is
structured as two packages with two scripts that call them.

The static structure still needs some refactoring and for sure there will be
modifications to the dynamic structure. 

% Figure \ref{pipestruct} is a representation of the dynamic structure,  
% with  arrows indicating \emph{imports from}.

% \articlefigure{P8989_f1.pdf}{pipestruct}{Dynamic structure of the
% pipeline in its current version 1.0b1. The arrows mean ``imports from''. This does not represent a workflow.}

For the next release we are developing a single-package structure that will
contain sub-packages with new features, such as a telemetry package that can be used
to monitor the instrument performance by comparing wavelength calibration parameters.
Another very important feature that we are developing is integrated code testing.

\section{Pipeline Use}
The Goodman pipeline has been developed to be easy to use. There are two scripts
or commands that you have to run in order to get fully processed data:
\verb=redccd= and \verb=redspec=.
\verb=redccd= is for the initial image processing, such as bias
subtraction and flat correction and \verb=redspec= is for the spectroscopic
part; identification, trace, extraction and wavelength calibration.
Both scripts can be called with no arguments and should work well for most general use cases
and well behaved data, but there is also the possibility of customizing the behavior
up to a certain level. As we mentioned in the introduction, we had to deviate from
our goal of having a purely Python-written pipeline and go with DCR which is a 
C program that works very well. Although the execution sequence was
gracefully integrated into the pipeline's workflow there is a rigidity regarding
parameter variation, because it uses a parameter file with a specific name and at
a specific location.

For parsing command line arguments we use the standard python library \verb=argparse= which
also allows easy integration with other ways of calling the script, from a GUI 
for instance or even from a Jupyter Notebook. Also, it provides nicely formatted 
help text upon argument failure or by using \verb=-h= or \verb=--help=

\subsection{redspec}

The spectroscopic reduction code was probably the most complex to develop, given
that Astropy's libraries were not ready at the moment. It starts by classifying 
the spectroscopic data, the output from \verb=redccd=, using a set of keywords 
from the header, an important point to highlight here is that this pipeline does not
rely on file names to classify the spectra, it only uses prefixes in order to filter
data and for the user to easily keep track of the processing done, otherwise, it
trusts that the header information is correct. As a result of the classification 
process it creates an object whose attributes contain information regarding the location
of the data, time reference points, such as, the sunset and sunrise time. It also
contain lists of \verb=pandas.DataFrame= instances that group all the images that
``belong together'' according to the classification scheme. It will consider three
possible scenarios: A comparison lamp that is not associated with any science target.
A science target that does not have associated any comparison lamp.
Groups of science targets and comparison lamps that are related to each other.

The target identification works by detecting the n-most intense peaks in the spatial
profile obtained by collapsing the spectrum image along the dispersion direction using
a median average. If there are any background features they are removed assuming the background 
should be flat. An equivalent implementation should be done for extended sources.

The tracing of the target is done by keeping track of the path of the spectrum's highest
point. This is one of the parts that need more development in order to work for fainter
sources or sources near very bright neighbors.

The current stable version has a simple extraction method only, meaning, it simply
sums the counts along the spatial direction within a rectangular region that
fully contains the spectrum.
A background subtraction is done by selecting a clear zone outside this rectangular
region and with the same number of pixels, if it is possible to get the background
level at both sides of the spectrum, an average of both background regions is 
calculated and if only one region is possible it is averaged and multiplied by
the width in pixels of the rectangular region that contains the spectrum.

Perhaps one of the most interesting parts of the code is the interactive and
automatic wavelength calibration. It relies on a library of previously calibrated
lamps, this makes things extremely easier compared to other methods you might think.
The interactive mode was developed to avoid the \emph{big wall} that the automatic
wavelength calibration meant at that early stage of development. It allowed us to 
understand how the data behaved in the wavelength regime. Also and very importantly
gave us the most useful insight that allowed us to later implement the automatic mode.
In order to obtain a wavelength solution in interactive mode, the user has to click-identify 
the lines in two plots one with a reference lamp plus reference line values and
another with the new lamp and marks of detected lines. The clicks are stored in
two lists that later are used to calculate the fit of a low order Chebyshev polynomial.
In Python this results in a callable object that you can give a pixel axis as argument 
and will return an axis in Angstrom. The use of the reference lamp is only for
\emph{visual reference}.

The automated wavelength calibration instead detects emission lines in the comparison lamps
and then splits the spectrum in an even number of parts according to the number of lines detected.
The reference lamp is also split. Equivalent portions are then cross-correlated 
thus obtaining an offset value for the corresponding center value, still in pixels, 
of the lines detected in the new comparison lamp. Using the mathematical model of the reference
lamp's wavelength-solution  the equivalent line center in angstrom is obtained 
using the following equation:
\begin{equation}
 angstrom = model(pixel + offset)
\end{equation}

As a first order filter for mismatched lines the cross-correlation values, which
are stored separated, will be sigma-clipped using 2-sigmas and one-iteration only.
This eliminates the most obvious mismatched lines. The ejected values also eject
their pixel and angstrom equivalents allowing to calculate a cleaner new wavelength solution.


Using the Angstrom values previously found and the detected lines
plus the newly calculated solution, the differences in angstrom are
calculated to which values a new sigma-clipping is applied, again
one iteration two-sigmas, since the distributions are not
necessarily normal distributions.

Once these values are cleaned of rejected values the final solution
is calculated using a low order Chebyshev polynomial.

\section{Results}
% \section{Conclusion}
The pipeline has met our expectation of being an efficient and fast
spectroscopic data processing tool. Although its scientific usefulness has not
been validated yet, we believe we are close because the results are
repeatable and consistent. Since there is no other production-ready pipeline
available for the Goodman Spectrograph data, at the moment we can only compare it to
IRAF. Figure \ref{irafcomp} contains the result obtained for the same spectrum using
the pipeline in automatic mode versus IRAF, by two different users. The good
match is evident even more when zooming in. 
We find that, using the 400 l/mm grating with the $1\arcsec$ slit, which yields
a resolution R$\sim 800$ (FWHM$\sim 6 \AA$), the pipeline produces an automated 
wavelength solution with RMS $\sim 0.3 \AA$. This is roughly the same RMS obtained
with IRAF.

\articlefigure{P8989_f2.eps}{irafcomp}{Results obtained using
the Goodman Pipeline compared to IRAF. There is an arbitrary vertical offset to
clearly set apart both results. The zoomed portion focuses on $H\alpha$, 
in emission, also allowing to view nearby features.}



\section{Future Work}

At the moment of writing the pipeline is in its first beta version and as
expected there are some features still missing. They should appear in future
releases. Examples are flux calibration, and a complete implementation of fractional pixel
extraction and optimal extraction \citep{1989PASP..101.1032M} and \citep{1986PASP...98..609H}.
We also want to change the Matplotlib UI by Qt UIs.

Other planned changes are: to modify the overall architecture of the pipeline,
since it started as two separated projects and evolved into a single one, there
is a development version that integrates everything as a single package. The 
ultimate goal in this regard is to make it comply with the Astropy Affiliated
packages standard although we need to evaluate how quickly we want that.

Talking about Astropy, there should be a replacement of tasks that are becoming
available in Astropy and Astropy Affiliated Packages as they mature, wavelength
solution storage for instance.

On the coding side itself we must implement test code and in fact we might switch
to a \emph{test driven development} philosophy.
