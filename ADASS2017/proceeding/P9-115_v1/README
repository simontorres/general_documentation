Preparing your manuscript:
-------------------------

Read the ManuscriptInstructions.pdf file.The ADASS_template.tex file gives you 
a basic template for your ADASS paper. For additional details look in the 
first section of the ASP's "Instructions for Authors and Editors", but note
that this is now some years old and current requirements have changed slightly.
In particular, ADASS papers that cite references MUST supply these references
in a .bib BibTeX file like the example.bib file provided here.

You will need to run LaTeX on your .tex file, then run BibTeX to process the
references, and then will need to run LaTeX again up to three times to get all
the cross-references right.

Checking your manuscript
------------------------

Your paper should typeset without generating any LaTeX errors or warnings. 
Overfull hbox warnings in particular need to be fixed. (In some cases underfull
hbox and vbox warnings may be tolerable.)

PaperCheck.py is a copy of a basic paper checking program that will be run by 
the ADASS editors on all submitted papers. It looks for a number of common
problems that have been found in submitted papers. You should run it on your
paper before packaging it up for submission, and should fix any problems it 
finds. The header comments in PaperCheck.py describe how to run it in detail,
but essentially all you have to do is:

PaperCheck.py Paper Author

where Paper is the identifier for your paper, eg O10-3 or P8-2 etc, and
Author is the surname of the first author of the paper.

(PaperCheck is written for Python2, but can be converted for Python 3 using the
2to3 Python utility if necessary. See its header comments.)

Packaging and submitting your paper:
-----------------------------------

You should create a .tar file with a name based on the identifier for your paper
e.g. example O10-3.tar. This should contain:

The .tex LaTeX file
The .bib file defining any cited references
And .eps graphics files used by the paper
The resulting .pdf file for the paper.
A signed copyright form.

(If there are problems typesetting your paper, your copy of the .pdf file for
the paper will at least show the editors what you expected it to look like. If
you have already supplied a paper copy of the copyright form, you do not need
to include this. Note that electronic signatures are not acceptable - sign the
form and scan it.)

(Zip files are also acceptable, using the same naming convention, eg 10-3.zip.)

Submit the .tar file as instructed on the ADASS 2017 web site. If you need to
submit a revised version, submit ALL the required files in a new .tar file - do
not just submit the modified files - and append a version number to the name,
eg O10-3_v1.tar.
