# Notes

## 400M1
  - FeHeAr neither Ar alone were tested.
  - CuHeAr: not good coverage
  - Ne: Crowded lines at 3rd 3rd
  - HgArNe: Better coverage towards red.
  
## 400M2 GG455
  - CuHeAr: Good only towards red.
  - Neither FeHeAr nor Ar alone were tested.
  
## 600UV 
  - Ne would requiere too long to get only a couple of lines 
  - FeHeAr requieres long time and does not have good coverage
  - Ar provides some lines but not really good
  
## 600Blue
  
## 930M1
  - HgAr: Can be used but there are only a few lines. And there is no good line
    towards the blue side.
  
## 930M2 
  - HgAr: Has only three lines, they are well distributed though and intensity
    is good.
  - HgArNe: same result as HgAr therefore Ne is useless
  
## 930M3 GG385
  

## 930M4
  - Ne lamp could be used alone
  - Ar and CuHeAr could be used but there is a large disparity on line intensity
    across the dispersion axis.
    Probably the features on CuHeAr are contributed by Ar alone.      
    
## 930M5
     
     
## 930M6

  - HgAr and HgArNe are almost identical because Ne requieres much longer
    exposure times
