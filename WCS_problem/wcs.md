## Source of documentation

The most important document is of course the 
[fits standard paper](fits_standard40aa.pdf) which is actually in evolution.
The list of versions can be found on 
[this link](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_standard.html).

Another interesting source is [Greisen et.al 2006](greisen-2006.pdf)

In general de fits standard paper is not a good experience for a user but it
must be the starting point since it defines de standard.
